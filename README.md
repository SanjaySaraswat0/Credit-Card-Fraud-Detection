# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is a major concern in the financial sector, with billions lost globally every year. Detecting fraudulent transactions accurately and quickly is critical for protecting consumers and financial institutions.

This project focuses on building a binary classification model using Logistic Regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains anonymized transaction features and is highly imbalanced, meaning that fraud cases are rare compared to genuine ones. This makes the detection task more challenging and requires careful preprocessing and evaluation.
